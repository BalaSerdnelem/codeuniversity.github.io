Welcome to CodeUniversity!

This site is currently new, so it could be called currently in it's beta version. Actually, it might be better 
if you don't try it out yet because it may not be complete.

!!!THANK_YOU!!! :smile:

A site where you can learn to code for free. This site is made by an 11-year-old who can't do anything but code.
